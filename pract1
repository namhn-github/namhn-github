# A simple kilograms to ounces conversion program
# It asks for a weight in kilograms (for example 10)
# and converts it to ounces (352.74)

    kilos = float(input("Enter a weight in kilograms: "))

#Anything below this line are the programming exercises for Worksheet 1

# 1. Write a function called say_name that displays your name.
def say_name():
    name = "Nam Hoang Nguyen"
    print(name)

# 2. Write a say_hello_2 function that uses two print statements to display the text below:
#   hello
#   world
def say_hello_2():
    print("hello")
    print("world")

# 3. Write a function called dollars_to_pounds which converts an amount in dollars entered by the user to a corresponding amount in pounds. Assume that the exchange rate is 1.35 dollars to the pound.
def dollars_to_pounds():
    dollars = float(input("Enter an amount in dollars: "))
    pounds = dollars / 1.35
    print("The amount in pounds is: ", pounds)

# 4. Write a sum_and_difference function that asks the user to enter two numbers (using two separate questions), and outputs their sum and their difference (the first number minus the second number).
def sum_and_difference():
    first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
    sum = first_number + second_number
    difference = first_number - second_number
    print("The sum and difference of your two numbers are: ", sum, difference)

# 5. Write a change_counter function. This should ask the user how many 1p, 2p and 5p coins they have (using separate questions), and then display the total amount of money in pence. Remember that variable names cannot begin with a number (instead of 2pence use two_pence).
def change_counter():
    one_pence_value = 1
    two_pence_value = 2
    five_pence_value = 5

    one_pence_count = int(input("How many 1p coins do you have?: "))
    two_pence_count = int(input("How many 2p coins do you have?: "))
    five_pence_count = int(input("How many 5p coins do you have?: "))
    total_coins = one_pence_value * one_pence_count + two_pence_value * two_pence_count + five_pence_value * five_pence_count
    print("The total amount of change you have is: ", total_coins)

# 6. Write a ten_hellos function that uses a loop to display “Hello World” ten times (on separate lines).
def ten_hellos():
    for _ in range(10):
        print("Hello World")

# 7. Write a zoom_zoom function that asks the user for a number and outputs “zoom” labelled from 1 to that number; for example, if the user enters 4, your function should output:
#   zoom 1
#   zoom 2
#   zoom 3
#   zoom 4
def zoom_zoom():
    zoom = int(input("How many times do you want zoom to be outputted: "))
    for i in range(1, zoom + 1):
        print("zoom", i)

# 8. Write a count_to function that asks the user for a number and then counts from 1 to that number.
def count_to():
    count = int(input("What number do you want to count to?: "))
    for i in range(1, count + 1):
        print(i)

# 9. Based on your solution to the previous question, write a function called count_from_to that asks the user for two numbers. The first number is the start of the count and the second one is where the count ends.
def count_from_to():
    first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    last_number = int(input("Enter the number to be counted to: "))

    for i in range(first_number, last_number + 1):
        print(i)
